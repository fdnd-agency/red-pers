## Description
We are a team of 4 students that have made a SSR website for our client Red Pers, using WordPress as headless CMS API. 

Red Pers is a journalist platform with 54 young, motivated poeple who are comitted to journalism. It is perfect for beginner or student journalists and writers to build their portfolio and share their stories. This website is only a year old and still a work in progress.

The goal of this project was to make the website more user-friendly and accessible. The site was not yet fully responsive and doesn’t work perfectly on all devices. We worked to change that. We focused on frontend design and development principles, standards, and best practices to create a solution for the client that follows RAP/PE. This includes responsiveness, accessibility, performance, and progressive enhancement.

## Techniques
The website was built using the following technologies:
* HTML – For the structure of the website
* CSS – For the styling
* JavaScript – For interactive functionalities
* SvelteKit – To set up a Svelte-based framework
* WordPress – Used as a headless CMS for content management via the API
* WP-API – For the connection between the website and the WordPress CMS
* npm – For package management
* GitHub – For collaboration
* Atomic design – Library structure
* View transitions – For an improved user experience
